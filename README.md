Description: The Iris Flower Classification ML model is designed to identify and categorize iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Leveraging features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the model employs a trained algorithm, often based on techniques like decision trees or support vector machines, to make accurate predictions. This model is commonly used in machine learning as a beginner-level classification task due to the well-known Iris dataset
